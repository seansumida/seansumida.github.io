I was in the scouting orginization for about 12 years, the heigest award one can recive from scouting is the rank of Eagle Scout.  One of the requirement for Eagle is "While a Life Scout, plan, develop, and give leadership to others in a service project helpful to any religious institution, any school, or your community." My project was to construct cubbies for Nuuanu Elementry School. I have fufulled this requirenment and have achived the Eagle rank.
