In ICS 211 I made a game where you control a shark using the WASD keys.  The objective of the game is to survive there is a food and thirst counter moving and getting hit by the hurricane will deplet these you can collect the musubi and water drops to increase your food and thirst.  The game was made in the programing language Java.  The most challenging aspect of this project was the collision of the character and hurricane.
