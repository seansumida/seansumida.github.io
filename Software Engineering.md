I’ve always been interested in computers ever since I was younger.  After I took my first programming class is when I really started to take an interest in computers and programming.  I really like the problem-solving aspect of software engineering.  In future ICS classes, I hope they will be more project-oriented and with people in a group and some solo projects.  My goal for the future is to work for some companies developing some video games, web page or maybe some app.  
	The feeling I get when I start coding going through the problem and having my code work out, in the end, is the best feeling I have ever experienced.  My favorite languages to code in are Javascript, HTML and, CSS.  I haven’t had many experiences in coding games but I think I would be very attracted to game development as well.  The feelings I have for software engineering are what drives me to keep learning.
In my future, I hope to do more projects to get more experience coding rather than having weekly assignments.  I would be interested in doing while collaborating with other people and also doing some solo projects.  I would be interested in learning python and SQL while also strengthening my skills in the other programming languages I have learned.  The skills I hope to lean will prepare me for the future goal I have made for myself to coding some game, web page, or, app.
