Design patterns are useful in software engineering by helping someone to plan out their project.  I think of them as a type of flow chart.  “I want my project to do this, then this, and lastly this” the design patterns would help you to visualize what you want to do to minimize any mistakes or confusion you might do.  These design patterns will be very helpful to know and use to help to eliminate the redundancy in code and help to make effective and efficient code with minimal errors.  

There are many different types of design patterns and at first, it seems like an impossible task to be able to learn and master them all.  I think a good way to approach this would be to use the appropriate design pattern for a certain problem you encounter.  With this approach, you could build up your repertoire of design patterns to use at your disposal.   

Now learning of design patterns they feel familiar because I was doing them but I wasn’t aware I had been doing so.  The ones I have been utilizing are factory and singleton.  Factory allows me to return objects from classes.  Singleton allows access to classes from everywhere.  I do think this is helpful in coding and I will continue to use these design patterns in the future.
