I’ve always been interested in computers ever since I was younger.  After I took my first programming class is when I really started to take an interest in computers and programming.  I really like the problem-solving aspect of software engineering.  In future ICS classes, I hope they will be more project-oriented and with people in a group and some solo projects.  My goal for the future is to work for some companies developing some video games, web page or maybe some app.  
The feeling I get when I start coding going through the problem and having my code work out, in the end, is the best feeling I have ever experienced.  My favorite languages to code in are Javascript, HTML and, CSS.  I haven’t had many experiences in coding games but I think I would be very attracted to game development as well.  The feelings I have for software engineering are what drives me to keep learning.
I have learned a lot in this ICS 314 class.  Some of the aspects that I learned can be applicable out side of softeare engineering.  Things like ethics in software engineering and design patterns.  Ethics isnt something usually associated with software engineering but should be applied to everthing you do while coding and not.  Design patterns are another aspect I learned that should be applied outside of coding aswell.  Design patterns are use to orginize your ideas and help you to produce what you have been working one with a clear outline.  I think design patterns will be useful in a lot of points in my life outside of coding.  
I would be interested in doing while collaborating with other people and also doing some solo projects.  I would be interested in learning python and SQL while also strengthening my skills in the other programming languages I have learned.  The skills I hope to lean will prepare me for the future goal I have made for myself to coding some game, web page, or, app.
