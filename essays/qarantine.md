The Covid19 pandemic has affected mostly everyone globally.  People have stopped working, stopped going to school, and the toilet paper stocks have been on the rise from all the people clearing stores of their supply.  Although, this is a serious deal I quite like the alteration of my schedule.  I get to become a bum that wakes up late and does nothing but sits all day and play video games, my father also stays home but he is more active than I, he does work and exercises to stay occupied.  My sister on the other hand, even though just starting and being part-time, is an essential worker for Safeway.  Since we are under quarantine we cannot go to school so we transitioned to learn online.  I don’t feel like I’m learning anything and I’m just doing the work to get it done.
