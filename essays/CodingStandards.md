Coding standards could be useful to help people learn coding languages and keeping things uniform.  There are a few programs to help guide programmers to follow these coding standards.  I personally don’t like coding standards.  I see coding like writing with paper and pencil, not everyone has the same writing style when it comes to size, font or writing style, the individual look of the letters but, we all do have the same base for writing.  The same goes for coding our functions look the same but someone might put the curly brace on the next line or the same line, just like someone could write their i’s with a point or a small circle, it has the same meaning it’s just personal preference on what the person wants their code looks like.  
I’ve used a few programs that helped to enforce the coding standards.  I have used Checkstyle for Java and recently I have been using ESlint for Javascript.  My opinion on them would align with how I feel about coding standards, I dislike them.  Although I do like ESlint in that they show errors with some indentation to help with nested code.  The thing I really dislike about ESlint, and other similar programs, is all the small nitpicky stuff, a space after the parenthesis, a new line after the last line you have, and other things that wouldn’t make a difference to the output to the code.  

I think coding standards have some good qualities about them but I do think they are too strict on the small things.  I want the creative freedom of putting my curly brace where I want, within logical reason, without some red line underneath bothering me.  I want to write my code how I want although It may look a little different from how the coding standards have set out for my code to look like.  Programs like ESlint are useful but I wish they would hold back on an extra space here or a not enough taps of the enter key there.
