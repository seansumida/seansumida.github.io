Why do we ask questions, questions at its core a sentence used to get an answer.  We need questions to get a better understanding of something we are unsure of.  Our basis for learning is based on what questions we ask. But, the question needs to asked in an appropriate and relevant setting.  So, it’s important to ask “Smart Questions”.  What are “smart questions”?  “Smart Questions” are made of a few standards.  Expressing your question after the topic has been researched such that a satisfactory answer is not found.  Asking your question to the appropriate replier.  Lastly, being accurate with what you are having trouble with, elaborate on all the relevant things for your problem.  

Here is an example of a “not smart question” found on stack overflow: 
“I have a problem with instant value. I want to get height value while website is working. For example; I designed two column in html. First column position property is absolute. So I want to align those two column. Second column is relative, height value is first column's height value. Thus, I guess two column are align instant. I try innerHeight with .css, .attr, .style and .prop. Also none of them don't work instant. What I can do ?”
Let us analyze this question, the question was asked to the appropriate audience being stack overflow.  The question was not researched well seeing as I could Google a tutorial.  I think the question could have been asked a little better by adding a reference to his code instead of saying what he tried to do.  

Here is an example of a “smart question” found on stack overflow:
“For anchors that act like buttons (for example, Questions, Tags, Users, etc. at the top of the Stack Overflow page) or tabs, is there a CSS standard way to disable the highlighting effect if the user accidentally selects the text?
I realize this could be done with JavaScript, and a little googling yielded the Mozilla-only -moz-user-select option.
Is there a standard-compliant way to accomplish this with CSS, and if not, what is the "best practice" approach?”
Let us analyze this question, the question was asked in stack overflow so, this would be the proper audience for this question.  This person did research on their question from them stating “I realize this could be done with JavaScript, and a little googling yielded the Mozilla-only -moz-user-select option.”  Lastly, this person did provide a good premise for their question from the beginning of their post.  


The benefits of asking “smart questions” are useful answers and the ability for more people to understand your issue and to reply to your question.  This can also benefit people that are having similar problem or problems as a part of their research portion before they ask a smart question of their own.
