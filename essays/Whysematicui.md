Making a website look appealing is not simple especially when using raw HTML and CSS.  Although there are other methods to make the process easier.  UI Semantic framework would be one of those methods.  UI Semantic works in a way where someone styling a website doesn’t need to write all the specific code to have the style look a certain way.  Rather they just reference the CSS to an element’s class.  This could be both good and bad in my opinion.  Semantic UI has its benefits by having the code you need in one CSS class.  It would be less of a hassle to remember the class and what it does rather than all the little things to make up the class of code.  On the other hand, I think it takes away from learning the CSS and have less knowledge of the applications for the raw CSS.  For example, if you’re joining a project that has already started without Semantic UI you could get stuck not knowing what you need.  Currently, learning Semantic UI is a little confusing for me.  I have prior CSS knowledge so I know all the little things that make up the CSS class.  I know how do make a webpage look a certain way using the longer method but, that’s how I know how to do it.  

I do see the benefits of using this Semantic UI framework.  So far, using the UI framework has an “ease of life” kinda feel to it.  I know exactly how the elements would look when I add the class to them.  Comparatively, using the raw CSS I would frequently check on the web page to make sure it’s looking like how I want it too.  There are so many different classes to add that make the page look much that much better.  I believe the UI frameworks do help software engineering in making their code finish just that little bit faster.  

Although the UI frameworks are fantastically efficient I do have personal gripes with it.  I have trouble with mixing the UI aspects with the raw CSS in that they sometimes conflict so I would need to redo the code with either the UI or the raw CSS.  I also find all the classes a little confusing to mix with each other.  But, these are all little things that can be easily resolved with a little more exposure to this Semantic UI framework.  The initial learning curve, personally with more experience with the raw CSS, makes understanding all the classes a little confusing but, it is enjoyable.
