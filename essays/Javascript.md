	I have had a few years of experience with javascript starting with STEM class throughout my time in High School and recently starting again with ICS 314.  I personally love javascript and it is one of my favorite programming languages.  Comparing javascript to other languages I have learned I do see some differences between them.  Nevertheless I still thoroughly enjoy using javascript and it will remain one of my favorite programming languages. 
 I started learning javascript in my STEM class while in my sophomore year of high school along with HTML and CSS.  I learned a lot about web development while taking this class.  The teacher I had was an excellent teacher that was very approachable and interactive and as a result, I had a really fun time coding in javascript.  Now taking ICS 314 I was really excited when I heard we were going to learn javascript.  While going through the code camp where we are learning javascript I found that I knew all the content in the program.  In ICS 314 we are doing WODs, which are coding problems that are timed.  Personally I HATE this, I don’t work well on timed things and I am a really slow typer which also doesn’t help me make the time requirement.  I enjoy the challenge of solving the problem I just don’t like the time restraint, I don’t think this type of learning will work well for me but I’m going to do all I can to make it work for me.  
During my time in University, I have learned a few other coding languages being Java, C, and C++.  In terms of logic, I think they are all, for the most part, the same but, I think javascript is a little more different in terms of the syntax.  I had this realization when first starting to learn java the same lines of code from javascript the little differences messed me up a little and now in the reverse order now.  Now learning how java, C and, C++ I see how they are a little less confusing compared to javascript.  As an example, the output of a function in javascript is not as precise compared to the other langers.
